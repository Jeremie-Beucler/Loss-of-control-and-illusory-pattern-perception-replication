# Loss-of-control-and-illusory-pattern perception - a conceptual replication of Whitson & Galinsky (2008)

This repository contains data and code for a conceptual replication of a [2008 Science paper](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1159845) by Whitson & Galinsky, which I conducted at the end of my Bachelor in Psychology in Paris. We failed to replicate the original effect, which did not surprise us (see also this [meta-analysis](https://doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2690)).
